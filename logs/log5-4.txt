okay so now what I need is to create an active/inactive toggle that goes inactive when the students departure date is reached
    then what is now Student.object.all() should be filtered by active or not. Also there should be a way to display the 
    inactive students
for tomorrow:
    finish assigning dates to the days to allow for filtering students
    fix formatting with the packed lunches sheets
    fix formatting so that sheet only takes up one page
    figure out rules for the changes in the job list
    add helpers to schedule
