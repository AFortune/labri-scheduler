Okay for today:
    first fix departures ck
    now find out about norman then do the new  sheets ck
    checking through master list
    
Reflection on work:
    this seems a little small at first but today I am somewhat blown away by what I can do by making 
        functions to do the various sub-part of my task. It is a pretty big deal actually because
        beforehand I never really thought of code interms of functions, and I have known that doing that is 
        important. I must continue to think about this.
