Issues:
    need to fix the second lunch functionality
    need to get the lunch info and learn how to input it in the right places
    need to assign things like night office and such
    It would be nice if there were an interface for changing the above added later
    Also need to learn how to filter job assignments based on work notes
    Also should add allergy note potentially
    programatically call the arrivals and departures
        add an 'active' column to the workers, students, and helpers, so old data can be saved
        maybe this should be part of meal assignments but probably unnecessary
